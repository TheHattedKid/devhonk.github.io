			<center><p>NOTE: So this BA! should have been published like, <em>months</em> earlier in a <strong>PDF</strong> but now that I have a website… Why not do it?
So everything really starts the 24th of Jaunary 2021 on the Discord server Arkode where the user Nedo(:&gt;) posts this</p>

<p>-Me</p>
<p>Then everyone complained about me wanting to only use C, official hueh moment.</p>
<p>The first method that I thinked of is of storing a big array of all of the pixels, of all the frames, but decided to scrape the idea because of the limited memory(for information, gint lets you only use 500kB of RAM(source: I dont know I just read the linker script and I may be wrong), so I'll just set this as the max amount of RAM you can use)
The second one is just to store it into a file, and that would be a good way because the graphing calculator has 16MiB of Flash usable by programs and in a USB Flash mode(funfact, my Manjaro partition is 128GiB, therefore, I would need almost 8000(8192 to be almost exact) FX-CG50s to put an image of my drive inside them)</p>
<p>I also wanted to originally use PrizmSDK, but it was a pain to install on Linux and other reasons, but quickly found out about <code>gint</code>, an epic unikernel or whatever for the fx-cg50(color) and fx(monochrome) calculators.
I also had a problem with me losing my graphing calculator(sadly) but since I am an idiot it was in my bag ( :^| ) so fast forward to April :^), when I release <a href="https://youtu.be/0to33n63xKo">my demo</a> to the WOOOORRRLDDD!!!(literally 2 months after nedo does his Bad Apple on Notepad) and release the program on Planète Casio and TI-Planet, <em>fin</em>.</p></center
